Torrenter by Tony Thompson
This program, exectuted by using ./main.py does the following:
Given an RSS feed URL for internet TV shows, podcasts, etc... torrents, it will download the latest shows in the feed, and if left running, will update automatically.
It will also update a given TV show library folder in the form Show Name/Season x /filename.
  if no seasons it will save as Show Name/filename
